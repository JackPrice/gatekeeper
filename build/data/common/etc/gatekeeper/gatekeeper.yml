# Replication configuration
#
# This section configures replication - how gatekeeper discovers and
# communicates with other nodes in a cluster
#
replication:

  #
  # Replication type
  #
  # Defaults to `local`
  #
  # Available types are `local` and `consul`.
  # Note that the local replication type does not support clustering or
  # high-availability, so can only provide a single-node cluster.
  #
  type: local

  #
  # If this value is true, this node is eligable to be a server.
  #
  # Defaults to `false`
  #
  # Server nodes provide the brains of the cluster, and are allowed to perform
  # operations such as managing endpoints and issuing certificates.
  # Your cluster must have at least one server to be useful.
  #
  server: true

#
# Backend configuration
#
# The backend configuraiton specifies where and how gatekeeper should store
# data.
#
# Remove this section if this node is not configured functioning as a server.
#
backend:

  #
  # Backend type
  #
  # Defaults to `local`
  #
  # Available types are `local` and `consul`
  # The local backend provider DOES NOT PERSIST DATA.
  #
  type: local

  #
  # Backend key
  #
  # The backend uses the specified key to encrypt data stored. It can be any
  # free-form text value.
  #
  # Change this to a secure value after installation!
  #
  key: ReplaceMeWthASecretPhrase

#
# Outputs configuration
#
# Outputs specify a way to output certificates, and a node can have any number.
#
outputs: []

  #
  # Output type
  #
  # Available types are `directory`.

#- type: directory

  #
  # Endpoint tag
  #
  # This optional section lets you filter the endpoints that this output
  # recieves by the given tag.
  #
#  tags: arbitrary_tag

  #
  # Endpoint domain filter
  #
  # This optional secition lets you filter the endpoint that this output
  # receives by a wildcard domain filter.
